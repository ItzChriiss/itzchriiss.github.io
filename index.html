  <h3> About Chris</h3>
<p>   Ever since I was old enough to use a computer, I have been obsessed! Growing up, I used to play a lot of games on the computer. One day, while searching for help on a game, I discovered the tutorial/walkthrough side of YouTube.From that day on, I began using YouTube as a reference to help me build skills in various programs.</p>    
    <p>  I learned how to edit videos, use Photoshop, mod games, and even build computers from scratch! Learning all those skills was so beneficial for me to find what I really wanted to dedicate my life to as a career. Building something from scratch and seeing it come to life has always given me such a good feeling inside. I came across web development a few years ago and have loved the idea of it since. I attended school for graphic design after high school but came to realize I wanted to really dive more into the development side of software. All of this led me to my true passion!</p>
